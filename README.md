# Braintrust to Snowflake Export Pipeline

This repository contains documentation and configuration files for setting up an automated data pipeline that exports data from Braintrust to AWS S3 and then ingests it into Snowflake using Snowpipe.

## Overview

The pipeline consists of two main components:

1. **Braintrust S3 Export Automation**: Automatically exports Braintrust data (logs, traces, spans) to an AWS S3 bucket
2. **Snowflake Snowpipe**: Continuously monitors the S3 bucket and automatically ingests new data into Snowflake tables

## Architecture

```
Braintrust â†’ S3 Bucket â†’ Snowpipe â†’ Snowflake
```

- **Braintrust**: Source system containing logs, traces, and evaluation data
- **S3 Bucket**: Intermediate storage for exported data files (JSON or Parquet format)
- **Snowpipe**: Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service
- **Snowflake**: Target data warehouse for analytics and reporting
